# Deallocation (free): 
- The current implementation doesn't allow for freeing memory. 
- Implementing free() would involve keeping track of allocated blocks and merging free blocks to avoid fragmentation.

# Memory Block Tracking: 
- You could add a system to track which blocks have been allocated and which are free, to handle memory deallocation or block reuse more efficiently.

# Alignment: 
- Right now, all memory is allocated in byte chunks. 
- For certain systems, you might need to ensure that allocations are aligned to specific boundaries (e.g., 4-byte or 8-byte boundaries for certain types of data).

# Memory Block Headers: 
- Another improvement could be adding a header to each block, which contains metadata about the size of the block, allowing for more sophisticated memory management, like free block coalescing and defragmentation.

# Thread Safety: 
- This allocator is not thread-safe. If multiple threads are involved, you would need to add synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes or atomic operations.
