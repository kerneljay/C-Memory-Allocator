# Pooling Smaller Allocations: 
- In many systems, small objects are allocated and freed frequently. Using a separate pool for smaller objects (a "small object pool") could improve performance by reducing fragmentation and improving allocation times.

# Binning/Block Size Optimizations: 
- Instead of allocating one large memory block, a pool could be subdivided into smaller blocks of fixed sizes. 
- This technique is often used in high-performance allocators like the Google's TCMalloc or jemalloc.
